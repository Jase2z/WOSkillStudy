WOSkillStudy
============
A python script which uses regex searches on event lines. I want to find the lest number of regex searches to identify all
possible skill gain derived event lines.

At this stage I'm matching skill gain time stamps with event line time stamps. Then see if any of the regex searches match 
one of those event lines.
